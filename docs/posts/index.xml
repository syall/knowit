      <description>Just like human languages, programming languages also have idioms.
Just as people who use the same language have characteristic ways of speaking thoughts, programming language users have characteristic ways of coding ideas.
Programming Idioms come with the class of a problem paired with language implementation.
For example, Go is a language that strongly enforces idiomatic solutions to practically every problem, even formatting and commenting.
On the other hand, Perl and Raku are languages that embrace the philosophy &amp;ldquo;there&amp;rsquo;s more than one way to do it&amp;rdquo; (TIMTOWDI), so it is idiomatic to do it whichever way you see fit.</description>
